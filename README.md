- 👋 Hi, I’m @Eduard-o (Eduardo Abreu) a Computer Science graduate from the College of Charleston.
- 👀 I’m interested in Game Development, Discord Bot Development, and all sorts of DIY electronics projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on the Old-School RuneScape Quest Graph project. A little side project to better show quest requirements.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a game or bot project. Anyone that is willing to mentor is also welcomed to reach out.
- 📫 You can reach me via Discord: Rutsy#6319 and other forms of communication that we can discuss later on.
