- 👋 Hi, I’m @Eduard-o (Eduardo Abreu) a Computer Science graduate from the College of Charleston.
- 👀 I’m interested in Game Development, Discord Bot Development, and all sorts of DIY electronics projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on Astro, a Discord bot that focuses on a certain game's statistics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a game or bot project. Anyone that is willing to mentor is also welcomed to reach out.
